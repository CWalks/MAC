Mini Arithmetic Calculator/Compiler

MAC is a small educational project inspired by an example in *Modern Compiler Design* by
Dick Grune et al. It serves as both an **interpreter** and a **demo compiler** for algebraic expressions.

## Features
- Parses and evaluates fully bracketed expressions (example: `(32 * (4 + 5))`)
- Build an abstract syntax tree (AST)
- Supports code generation and interpretation
- Supports basic use of variables

## Goals
- Learn more how basic compiler construction works
- Look at both interpretation and code generation
- Work with parsing, lexing, and AST

For more information on how to use MAC read SYNTAX.md
