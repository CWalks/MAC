Mini Arithmetic Calculator/Compiler

MAC is a small educational project inspired by an example in *Modern Compiler Design* by
Dick Grune et al. It serves as both an **interpreter** and a **demo compiler** for algebraic expressions.

## Wanted Features
- Parses and evaluates fully bracketed exprestions (example: `(3 * (4 + 5))`)
- Builds an abstract syntax tree (AST)
- Supports code generation and interpretation 

## Goals
- Learn more how basic compiler construction works
- Look at both interpretation and code generation
- Work with parsing and AST


This is the book that inspired me to make This
