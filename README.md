# MAC
Mini Arithmetic Calculator/Compiler

MAC is a small educational project inspired by an example in *Modern Compiler Design* by
Dick Grune et al. It serves as both an **interpreter** and a **demo compiler** for algebraic expressions.

## Features
- Parses and evaluates fully bracketed expressions (example: `(32 * (4 + 5))`)
- supports additon and multiplication
- Build an abstract syntax tree (AST)
- Supports code generation and interpretation

## Goals
- Learn more how basic compiler construction works
- Look at both interpretation and code generation
- Work with parsing, lexing, and AST

*For more information on how to use MAC read SYNTAX.md*

## After Development
I have gotten to a point were I am happy with my progress with MAC. I have a couple of ideas
that might be nice to add, more operations, variables, ect but I believe they are out of the scope of
this project, as of now. This started as a "foot into the door" on how programing langaues work so I
mainly focused on understanding lexical analyzer, parsing and code gen. The idea is not to make a 
Turing complete language but for me to learn how the complier pipeline works and to get an idea on how
programing languaes are constructed. It started from following a simple example in the intro chapter of 
*Modern Compiler Design* to prove to myself that I understand the basics of C and soon grew into passion 
project were I made it a CLI tool and added my own backend and main driver for the code. Documenting 
my progress has also been a learning experince, I know now to keep my git history cleaner (lol). 
I really enjoyed working on this and between MAC reading more about compilers, and learning about PL online,
my intrest in the field has grown and I now want to study PL in school!
