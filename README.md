Mini Arithmatic Calculator/Compiler

MAC is a small educational project inspired by an example in *Modern Compiler Design* by Dick 
Grune et al.  
It serves as both an **interpreter** and a **demo compiler** for algebraic expressions.

## Features
- Parses and evaluates arithmetic expressions (example: `3 * (4 + 5)`)
- Builds an abstract syntax tree (AST)
- Supports code generation and interpretation 

## Goals
- Learn more how compiler construction works
- Explore both interpretation and code generation paths
- Practice parsing techniques and AST design
